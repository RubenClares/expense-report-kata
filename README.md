# expense-report-kata

This is a dotnet version of [expense report kata](https://github.com/christianhujer/expensereport)

## QA Version

You can run the expense report application and type expenses, as soon as you hit enter twice your report will be generated.
The accepted expense are as follows:
- DINNER 
- BREAKFAST 
- CAR_RENTAL

You need to state your expenses like 

DINNER 1000

## Automated test

Currently there is no test whatsoever, therefore you are expected to cover the following scenarios:
- No expense at all
- One expense under limit
- One expense over limit
- All the possible permutations in one list.

We will not use any approval test framework on this instance. You will write all the tests and scenarios.
